## How It Works
The script performs the following steps:

- Updates the Undervisningstyp column if it is "Se kommentar".
- Combines Kurs and Undervisningstyp into a new column Subject that will appear as the calender event title:
- Adds an "â“˜" symbol if there is additional information in the "Information till student" column.
- Adds the room name in parentheses if there is a room name specified.
